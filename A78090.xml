         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Now from the≈øe ≈øeveral acceptations of the word <hi>fle≈øh,</hi> we gather, <note place="margin">Four ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations from that.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, what man is ≈øince the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> Take him with all abilities in his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170485:17"/> be≈øt e≈øtate here, out of Chri≈øt, he is but weak, frail, mortal and ≈øinful fle≈øh; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and ≈øinful man: he is fle≈øh, that is, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ≈øen≈øual, and wholly corrupted with ≈øin; he is utterly unable to keep the holy Law of God, to fulfill the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the Law, to make ≈øatisfaction to Gods ju≈øtice for the lea≈øt ≈øin, by all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈ø≈øe he can by him≈øelf attain unto. And therefore wholly unable to e≈øcape condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may here learn that the fle≈øh, that is, man con≈øi≈øting of body and ≈øoul, though frail and mortal, even weak, dying fle≈øh, enfeebled in his abilities and operations both of body and mind, is not in that regard ≈øinful; for then the Son of God who became fle≈øh, who took on him our nature, a true humane ≈øoul and body, and our nature infirme, frail and mortal, our very fle≈øh and blood, mu≈øt needs have been defiled with ≈øinne; but he knew no ≈øinne, he was the Lamb without ≈øpot and blemi≈øh: therefore the fle≈øh, or body of man is not evil as it is fle≈øh and blood, nor the de≈øires, appetite or weakne≈ø≈øe, frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and di≈øea≈øes that attend it, no more than the minde the top of the ≈øoul, the will and affections of the ≈øoul are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170485:18"/> evil. God is the former of our bodies, as well as the Father of our ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and God is not the Author of ≈øinne: this is diligently to be heeded again≈øt the dreams of mo≈øt Hereticks, old and new, again≈øt the general ≈øayings of Philo≈øophers, and the common and u≈øual conceits all men have of the fle≈øh or body, as if that were the evil ≈øinning, blame-worthy part in them; but their ≈øouls, their hearts, their minds, the ≈øpirit of the minde, that they think to be good and holy, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its defilement from the body. And therefore men place all Religion in ≈øome ob≈øervations of ab≈øtinence bodily, bodily exerci≈øes, as, Touch not this, ta≈øte not that, and handle not the other; or in ≈øome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting of the body, macerating and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhing it, and denying ≈øatisfaction to the poor fle≈øh in the natural de≈øires thereof, unto which weak body there is an honour due: whereas all that defiles a man is from within, from the heart and ≈øoul of man, from the≈øe good hearts of ours comes all wickedne≈ø≈øe, as our Lord Je≈øus tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here we are taught that there is ≈øomething in man farre wor≈øe than death, mortality, frailty, or any di≈øea≈øe or pain;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170485:18"/> even that which brought all this upon him, and that is <hi>≈øinne</hi> which we make ≈øo light of; ≈øinne is the wor≈øt thing in the world; ≈øin is farre wor≈øe than affliction, than all deaths.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, here may be ≈øeen how near the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the Sonne of God came unto us; he came ≈øo near, that he took to him≈øelf in neare≈øt union, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our ≈øouls, which are ≈øpiritual ≈øub≈øtances, but our very bodies; he took to him our fle≈øh and blood; he took to him our whole nature, and that in the condition which ≈øinne had brought it unto; the very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of ≈øinful fle≈øh, our infirme nature; a ≈øoul ≈øubject to ≈øome kind of ignorance, to affections of love, anger and ≈øorrow; a body ≈øubject to hunger, thir≈øt, nakedne≈øs, cold, wearine≈ø≈øe; a frail mortal man he was, but wholly without ≈øinne: yea, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted as we are, like us in all things, ≈øin only excepted; <hi>he became fle≈øh.</hi> He did not a≈ø≈øume our nature as it was in our fir≈øt Parents in their innocency, but as it is now ≈øince the fall; he came not into the world in the form of a King, or ≈øome great Monarch, or of an honourable per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øon, or rich and wealthy; no, nor of a free-man, but of a ≈øervant; he became <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170485:19"/> poor and de≈øtitute of all; naked fle≈øh<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold the grace, the great love of the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> behold it, till thy heart be loo≈øe from all that men here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and doat upon, and begin to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Lord, the Son of the mo≈øt High, who di≈ødained not to come ≈øo low to ≈øeek after and exalt thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we have the per≈øons di≈øtinct, <note place="margin">2.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Then the Sonne of God Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> he is incarnate, he becomes fle≈øh; he payes the price of Redemption by ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the damnatory ≈øentence of the Law, he fulfills the righteou≈øne≈øs required in the commands of the Law.</p>
                  <p>And la≈øtly, <hi>The Spirit he unites to Chri≈øt, that this might he in us through faith;</hi> he applies and brings home with power all this that the Father and Son have done; he thru≈øts out the fle≈øh, the power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature: and regenerates, ≈øanctifies and rules in them ≈øo mightily, that they walk

The Doctrine or Law of Faith in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, that e≈øtabl≈øheth the Law every way, and doth that for the ≈øinner which the Law

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That condemnation, death and hell have their power from ≈øinne: and ≈øinnes ≈øtrength to condemn lyeth in the Law and in the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe thereof; for mark here, God to deliver from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, condemns ≈øinne: and ≈øinne being the ≈øwerving from the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the Law, for which the Law ≈øentenceth the Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øor thereof with the cur≈øe, ≈øin is then utterly gone, when the righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the Law is every way fulfilled.

The ≈øting of death is ≈øinne, and the ≈øtrength of ≈øinne is the Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 56. Full ≈øalvation can no other way be wrought, but by un≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging death, and by fulfilling the Law; which is the only way to pluck out deaths ≈øting: let this be done, and the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from ≈øinne and death is full and compleat.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the benefit of Gods ≈øaving love, and of the Redemption by Chri≈øt, and of the Go≈øpel, is never to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man actually, till it be in him; and if

                  <p>That which commends this work of the Spirit yet further, is this, that is, is peculiar and appropriated unto the Elect of God the Father, and to the Redeemed of Chri≈øt the Lord. The Spirit of truth is the Comforter, his work under the New Te≈øtament as Comforter, is ≈øuch a work as

Not as if their great ≈øinnes ≈øhall condemn them: no, for Je≈øus Chri≈øt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates not only for le≈ø≈øer ≈øinnes, but for the greate≈øt ≈øinnes: and God forgiveth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, and ≈øinne; ≈øinnes of all ≈øorts, and of all ≈øizes; but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that Chri≈øt is ≈øuch a propitiation that the≈øe are covered; ≈øuch an Advocate that he pleads to the Father, that the≈øe by <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1.</note> the tenour of the Covenant of grace be wholly pa≈ø≈øed by; he is ≈øuch an high Prie≈øt, as is touched with the feeling of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; for though he never knew what it was to ≈øinne, no, not of infirmity; he knew no ≈øin: yet he was tempted, and ≈øo <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> is touched with the feeling of the ≈øtate of one that cannot be free from ≈øome touch of defilement when he is tempted. God
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170485:175"/> is a Father who is ≈øo far from being angry <note place="margin">P≈øa. 103. 13 Mal. 3. 17.</note> with his children for the≈øe meer infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he pities them, ≈øpares them, and makes them up as his Jewels; but as for their g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o≈ø≈øe ≈øinnes, they are they for which their Father is angry, with-holds his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, his Spirit, and their joy: and no con≈øolation to them in ≈øinnes they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge, untill they be humbled deeply. Again, under≈øtand this aright: The≈øe ≈øins condemn not; not as if le≈ø≈øer ≈øinnes were not di≈øplea≈øing unto God their Father, to Chri≈øt their Lord, and to the Spirit their Leader: nor as if they might not be ≈øo committed, that they may become great ≈øinnes, through carele≈ø≈øene≈ø≈øe and ≈øecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ≈øo as they may be circum≈øtanced. Nay. A failing may be ≈øo allowed, ≈øo cu≈øtomary, ≈øo malapertly, and frowardly excu≈øed and pleaded for, that it may have too much of pre≈øumption in it: and ≈øo have much wickedne≈ø≈øe in it, and have much of the nature of a great tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion; and therefore may have in it much provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that which calls for great humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, before any comfort can flow into the ≈øoul of ≈øuch a one.</p>
