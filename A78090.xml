         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170485:4"/> to the Will of God. Here ſupreme, and ſent of the ſupreme is order and beauty; bands and beauty. Lawes againſt evil-doers, and for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of wel-doers, with execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Lawes, for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they beare the ſword, are of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that Magiſtracy in its various Creations may attain its end. But in the Church <hi>all things are of God;</hi> and whatever is of man, is alien to that Society. The grand enemies of the Church under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are the Dragon, the Beaſt, the falſe Prophet: this laſt is the moſt dangerous; the Beaſts and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, ſpiritual wickedneſſe and power, the animating vivacity of that luſtful Whore, <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great, the Woman that rides the beaſt. And the Beaſt is a Beaſt, whether ariſing out of the ſea, or out of the earth, or aſcending out of the bottomleſſe pit. And the Dragons poiſon and paw is in all, and all to
<pb facs="tcp:170485:4"/> miſchief the Church of Chriſt. This Paradiſe he affects to be in, becauſe not his place: but chiefly out of his love, his love to work ruines there. How ſlily, how inſenſibly ſlides in this old Serpent? humane here, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane of what note ſoever, and Satan preſently Acts it. Chriſt knew it well, who ſaid to <hi>Peter, Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me; for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men.</hi> The love-feaſts ſhrowd diviſions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, deſtroy the Lords Supper, and harbour ſlie and ſpotty Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and deceivers. Prelacy in the miniſtery, though brought in <hi>ad tollenda ſchiſmata</hi> to take away ſchiſmes, brings forth <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> and with him <hi>the myſtery of iniquity.</hi> An <hi>Eaſter</hi> day fill'd the Chriſtian world, Eaſt and Weſt with miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contentions, and turn'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſts name after forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and meer Nifles. The reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:170485:5"/> ſolitarineſſe of ſome eminently devout, filled it with Monkery, Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, and the ſwarmes of the orders of ſuch. Commandments of men received to teach the feare of God, do Null the Commandments of God. Mens opinions choſen for the rationality, or the depth of them, have proved <hi>the depths of Satan.</hi> Mens Inventions entertained for their ſuitableneſſe to humane Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, have, while ſerved the luſts of men in Magiſtracy, trampled on Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, enthroned Tyranny, and ſuborned for ſacred, Maximes that are the hornes to puſh at and gone all the godly and the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: Such as theſe; <hi>No Biſhop, no King. Chriſts Kingdome is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Caeſar. Chriſts ſimple Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for worſhip, without the pompe of humane Ceremonies, are not for the State and Majeſty of Princes.</hi> That is, the world knows his own, and will know nothing but his own. It
<pb facs="tcp:170485:5"/> hath been long and lamentably expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented, that the evils of the Church have ever diſturbed the ſtate. That which corrupts men, and ſets up luſt, muſt needs be againſt God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Magiſtracy which is from God. The Goſpel in its purity will help all this evil, will bring with it all good; this Goſpel is one: the name of them that hold that <hi>one faith</hi> is ſacred, the name <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> The love it teacheth and worketh, is the bond that knits them together in <hi>one brother-hood;</hi> love is for Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not for ſingle ſtanding, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nor dividing. Its power is as ſweet, as ſtrong; as beautiful, as powerful; as good, as commanding.

One way, and one heart go together. Diverſities of wayes, nurſes up di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of heart.

            <p>The ſtrange croſſeneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of things that ſtands out in theſe Goſpel-dayes, and riſes ſo ſtoutly for one againſt another, ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes the beſt heads, and ſtaggers, yea, confounds the ſtouteſt hearts that are by place and office to manage them; here are with us in one womb the old revived ſtrugglings of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and profaneſt; the pureſt and the ſubtleſt; the moſt for power, and the moſt denying of the power of godlineſſe; the moſt zealous, and the moſt formal and richly goodly luke-warme; the weightieſt grain, and the lighteſt chaffe; the deeplieſt poor in ſpirit, and the loftieſt proud in the fleſh; the heaven-born Sons of marvelous light, and the hell-born brats of thickeſt darkneſſe: theſe cauſe difficulty to rule, ſo as to foſter the gracious, and diſcountenance the wicked, ſevering the precious and the vile.

The Apoſtle drawes up all that he had delivered in this Epiſtle, for the practice of the Saints, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for their conſolation againſt all ſorts of evils that may befal them in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <note place="margin">Two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, ſinne and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> world. Now becauſe there are two ſorts of evils which aſſault their faith, and that ſorely and dangerouſly, which are, the ſenſe of the remainders of ſin within them, and the manifold afflictions, tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and temptations that befal them from without: two evils, ſinne and the Croſſe; ſin that dwells in them, and the <note place="margin">Comfort in Chriſt to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both.</note> Croſs that attends them from abroad: The Apoſtle againſt both theſe doth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly comfort all believers. And this he doth, not without cauſe.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170485:12"/> carry them away captives? and is it not alwayes averſe and adverſe to their holy inclinations unto, and delight in the law of the Lord? <hi>Paul</hi> in his own perſon ſets out the eſtate of a believer to be ſuch, in the latter end of the ſeventh chapter. If this be the eſtate of thoſe that believe, and that have in them the beginnings of grace and ſanctification, How can they be comforted? for is not ſin to be regarded? is not ſin the more grievous, the more good and gracious God is to them? and ought it not ſo to be? do not their ſouls hate ſin the more, and are therefore the more troubled becauſe ſuch corruptions ſtir in them, and break forth againſt God? the Apoſtle grants it all: but for full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation ſets Jeſus Chriſt againſt this evil of ſin, and aſſerts, that their ſins ſhall not condemn them. <hi>There is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> This is ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170485:13"/> how then ſhall they have comfort? Where is the gaine of godlineſſe? The Apoſtle ſaith, there is this certaine truth full of Conſolation, that all afflictions that can befal the believer, are ſo farre from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing his ſalvation, that they promote and aſſure unto him his greater glory in verſe 17. and this argument is continued unto the 31. verſe. And then in the 31. verſe to the end, the Apoſtle breaks out into a triumph of faith over both evil, ſin and affliction; over all that may ſtand in the way of their comfort, not leaving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he hath raiſed them together with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in deſpight of all adverſe things, to the height of one more than a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and to the glorying of one that is fully aſſured.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170485:13"/> condemned, and the righteouſneſſe of the Law which is the ſtrength of ſin, is fulfilled. What condemnation can there be where ſin is condemned, and where all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is fulfilled? and this is the true caſe of all that are in Chriſt; beſides, they are under another law, even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt after whom they walk, and who from Chriſt is in them, lawing of them; So that they who are in Chriſt Jeſus are not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another Law, but the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus, and from him a their Head, and as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> is in them as a Law, even the Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life which delivers them from the Law of ſin and death: this is the ſumme of the ſecond <hi>verſe; what is this law of the Spirit?</hi> It is the Spirit of grace and <note place="margin">What is the Law of the Spirit.

                  <p>The former <hi>Objection</hi> may yet be urged; for it may be ſaid, the Law is righteous, and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle explaineth the <note place="margin">Yet the Law is in no fault.</note> thing, and amplifieth it; the Law cannot do it: not that there is fault in the Law; this impoſſibility cometh through the weakneſſe of mankinde now fallen, who are not able to keep the Law. The Law is not weak, as if not perfectly righteous and holy; or as if it had not a promiſe of life annexed to it: but you are weak, who are not able to keep it. It is through mans weakneſſe, who is not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the righteouſneſſe thereof, that the Law is become weak: the perfect, exact holineſſe thereof makes through our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe weakning it, that none can ſtand righteous by it, nor live by it. Hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth the inpoſſibility of help by the Law. Thus the Law is ſtill preſerved honourable, and is magnified, when yet it cannot help us; and we are in the fault, the fault is wholly ours.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Apoſtle diſplayeth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel <note place="margin">2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it notes the corruption or ſinfulneſſe of mans nature; in the words [walk not after the <hi>fleſh.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now from theſe ſeveral acceptations of the word <hi>fleſh,</hi> we gather, <note place="margin">Four ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations from that.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, what man is ſince the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> Take him with all abilities in his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170485:17"/> beſt eſtate here, out of Chriſt, he is but weak, frail, mortal and ſinful fleſh; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and ſinful man: he is fleſh, that is, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ſenſual, and wholly corrupted with ſin; he is utterly unable to keep the holy Law of God, to fulfill the righteouſneſſe of the Law, to make ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice for the leaſt ſin, by all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe he can by himſelf attain unto. And therefore wholly unable to eſcape condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may here learn that the fleſh, that is, man conſiſting of body and ſoul, though frail and mortal, even weak, dying fleſh, enfeebled in his abilities and operations both of body and mind, is not in that regard ſinful; for then the Son of God who became fleſh, who took on him our nature, a true humane ſoul and body, and our nature infirme, frail and mortal, our very fleſh and blood, muſt needs have been defiled with ſinne; but he knew no ſinne, he was the Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh: therefore the fleſh, or body of man is not evil as it is fleſh and blood, nor the deſires, appetite or weakneſſe, frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſeaſes that attend it, no more than the minde the top of the ſoul, the will and affections of the ſoul are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170485:18"/> evil. God is the former of our bodies, as well as the Father of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and God is not the Author of ſinne: this is diligently to be heeded againſt the dreams of moſt Hereticks, old and new, againſt the general ſayings of Philoſophers, and the common and uſual conceits all men have of the fleſh or body, as if that were the evil ſinning, blame-worthy part in them; but their ſouls, their hearts, their minds, the ſpirit of the minde, that they think to be good and holy, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its defilement from the body. And therefore men place all Religion in ſome obſervations of abſtinence bodily, bodily exerciſes, as, Touch not this, taſte not that, and handle not the other; or in ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting of the body, macerating and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing it, and denying ſatisfaction to the poor fleſh in the natural deſires thereof, unto which weak body there is an honour due: whereas all that defiles a man is from within, from the heart and ſoul of man, from theſe good hearts of ours comes all wickedneſſe, as our Lord Jeſus tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here we are taught that there is ſomething in man farre worſe than death, mortality, frailty, or any diſeaſe or pain;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170485:18"/> even that which brought all this upon him, and that is <hi>ſinne</hi> which we make ſo light of; ſinne is the worſt thing in the world; ſin is farre worſe than affliction, than all deaths.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, here may be ſeen how near the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Sonne of God came unto us; he came ſo near, that he took to himſelf in neareſt union, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our ſouls, which are ſpiritual ſubſtances, but our very bodies; he took to him our fleſh and blood; he took to him our whole nature, and that in the condition which ſinne had brought it unto; the very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinful fleſh, our infirme nature; a ſoul ſubject to ſome kind of ignorance, to affections of love, anger and ſorrow; a body ſubject to hunger, thirſt, nakedneſs, cold, wearineſſe; a frail mortal man he was, but wholly without ſinne: yea, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted as we are, like us in all things, ſin only excepted; <hi>he became fleſh.</hi> He did not aſſume our nature as it was in our firſt Parents in their innocency, but as it is now ſince the fall; he came not into the world in the form of a King, or ſome great Monarch, or of an honourable per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, or rich and wealthy; no, nor of a free-man, but of a ſervant; he became <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170485:19"/> poor and deſtitute of all; naked fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold the grace, the great love of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> behold it, till thy heart be looſe from all that men here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and doat upon, and begin to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Lord, the Son of the moſt High, who diſdained not to come ſo low to ſeek after and exalt thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we have the perſons diſtinct, <note place="margin">2. Three diſtinct perſons, and works of thoſe perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, in a ſinners ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> with their diſtinct workings, who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſalvation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God the Father,</hi> he is ſending his own Son; he is condemning ſin, he is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and keeping whole and untoucht the righteouſneſſe of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Then the Sonne of God Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he is incarnate, he becomes fleſh; he payes the price of Redemption by ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the damnatory ſentence of the Law, he fulfills the righteouſneſs required in the commands of the Law.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, <hi>The Spirit he unites to Chriſt, that this might he in us through faith;</hi> he applies and brings home with power all this that the Father and Son have done; he thruſts out the fleſh, the power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature: and regenerates, ſanctifies and rules in them ſo mightily, that they walk
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170485:19"/> after the Spirit. <hi>[In us, who walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.]</hi> Who <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 23 Deut, 33. 29</note> are like unto Gods choſen: who are thus ſaved of the Lord? whom God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Sonne, and the Spirit thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme! for whom theſe three, yet one God do thus go forth and work, and are ſo employed to deliver from ſinne and damnation! Bleſſed and happy art thou, O Iſrael of God, whether Jew or Gentile, thus ſaved of the Lord!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have alſo here the ſummary <note place="margin">3. The two wayes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to mankind, in which everlaſting life might be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> comprehenſion of all the wayes that ever God gave to mankinde to obtaine life by, that is, the Law and the Goſpel. We have likewiſe the onely way by which mankinde fallen can poſſibly be delivered, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine everlaſting life, which is the Goſpel. And further, how theſe two, the Law and the Goſpel mutually do work: The Law comes, but is found weak, unable; and the deliverance of a ſinner thereby, a thing impoſſible; yet this Law takes off the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from his great confidence, leaves him at a loſſe, ſhuts him up to Chriſt, and to faith in him, when that ſhall come to help. The Doctrine or Law of Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, that eſtablſheth the Law every way, and doth that for the ſinner which the Law
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170485:20"/> could not do. By it, Gods love, and Chriſt Jeſus the Sonne of God the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, God in Chriſt is made known, the Spirit is given, the fleſh o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And withal, the words are ſo compoſed, that the ſumme of the Goſpel is briefly, orderly, plainly, practically (or as it may and muſt fall into practice) and fully ſet down here to our edification and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on abundantly.</p>

                  <p>Having thus farre unfolded the words; here are four precious and important <note place="margin">4. grand truths.</note> truths, three in the text, and one in the context. We have three moſt glorious and neceſſary truths of greateſt moment that can concerne us and our ſalvation, and the aſſurance thereof, laid down in open and expreſſe words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The impoſſibility of a ſinners ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any means ſave by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The abſolute fulneſſe of a ſinners ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The lively deſcription of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſinners who do obtaine ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170485:20"/>
                  <p> And then in the connexion of theſe words with the former, we have a fourth doctrine of excellent worth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fulneſſe of their aſſurance to be out of the reach of condemnation, and to be in the eſtate of ſalvation, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their conſolation who are actually in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="The firſt."/> Firſt, The impoſſibility of the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſinner by any means ſaving Jeſus Chriſt; This the Apoſtle teacheth when he ſaith, <hi>[What she Law could not do]</hi> It is that which the Law cannot do. It is (the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) the impoſſible thing of the Law. When he alſo ſaith further <hi>[In that it was weak]</hi> he teacheth that the Law is weak, and ſo is unable to give life, righteouſneſſe and ſalvation to a ſinner, and to deliver him from the Law of ſin and death. This is that thing (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>in which it is weak.</hi> The Law is a perfect rule of righteouſneſſe: It commands well. It is a holy and exact ſentencer of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, it judgeth righteouſly; but as for deliverance and ſalvation there it leaves a man that hath ſinned, and to that work it is utterly weak: that is the thing in which it is weak; therefore this impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the Law demonſtrateth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170485:21"/> of the Law to deliver a ſinner, And then when he ſaith <hi>[through the fleſh]</hi> that is, man, ſince the fall, taken with all his beſt abilities, and they and he in them upheld by God the Creator in riches of patience, and in riches of goodneſſe, and having in him the light of natural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and with him the book of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to read; and not onely the work of the Law written in his heart, but alſo the Law given to him from God by lively voice, and written in Tables of ſtone, and perpetuated in the holy Scripture; man thus ſuſtained and furniſhed with his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt improvement which he can make of the ſame, is but fleſh, weak fleſh, ſo weak that he hath brought this impoten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now <hi>through the fleſh,</hi> through man who is weak, the Law becomes weak: and deliverance from damnation and from ſin is that impoſſible thing of the Law, which man cannot have by the Law; thus this gate to life is faſt ſhut; yet the Law is ſet up in its due worth and power: and man caſt down under his deſerved blame: man is laid dead to the Law, and the Law dead
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170485:21"/> to man as to the matter of righteouſneſſe and ſalvation. Therfore alſo it unavoidably followeth that no other creature, nor meanes can deliver a ſinner: for what means (ſetting aſide Jeſus Chriſt) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the Law? or what creature is above the Law? this is the firſt doctrine.</p>

Now God ſent his Sonne, and held the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned courſe in laying our ſinnes upon him, that the whole righteouſneſſe which the Law requireth of us, might be fulfilled in us who are in Chriſt by faith, whiles by Jeſus Chriſt it is fulfilled for us, and for our ſakes, in our roome and ſtead: and ſo the Law is, while fulfilled for us, fulfilled in us
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170485:23"/> who are in Chriſt by faith. And then ſecondly, the holineſſe and righteouſneſſe of the precepts is fulfilled in us, whiles by this faith which unites us to Chriſt, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his Spirit, draweth from Chriſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying grace, and purifieth the heart, a new obedience in all uprightneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity reſpecting the whole Law is begun, and more and more encreaſeth in us in this life; &amp; is of that growing nature, that it will go forwards, hold on, fight out its way, perſevere and overcome, and at laſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in glory; thus the righteouſneſſe of the Law is in us; by faith Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe in obedience and ſufferings, for us reckoned to us as ours, and by the ſame faith holineſſe in truth begunne, and growing up to perfection in us.

Again, as for the moral Law, theſe two things the Scripture affirmes concerning it. 1.

The Law cannot ſave: for, Firſt, the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands righteouſneſſe, but giveth no ſtrength to do what it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, nor reſtoreth any loſt ſtrength. The Law promiſeth life, but it is to him that perfectly keepeth it; It promiſeth no good to a ſinner. Secondly, none can keep the Law, therefore none can by the Law attaine to righteouſneſſe through the weakneſſe of the fleſh, the diſability of fraile man to continue in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170485:27"/> all to do it, the Law is become impotent for juſtification. And without righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it is impoſſible there ſhould be life; or that there ſhould not be death and the curſe. Thirdly, If a ſinner could keep the Law for time to come, yet by the Law no good to him; becauſe he muſt firſt anſwer for his former tranſgreſſions, and dye the death, accurſed of God his Maker becauſe of them. The Law was not given of God, that righteouſneſſe and life might be <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20 &amp; 7. 7. Ver. 9. 14. &amp; 7. Ver. 13.</note> obtained thereby: but it was given, that by it a ſinner might come to the knowledg of ſinne; that he might know what is ſin; that luſt, or coveting is ſinne; that our natures are wholly polluted, and that we <note place="margin">For what ends the Law was given.</note> are carnal, ſold under ſinne, who can hold no proportion to the plat-forme of righteouſneſſe which the Law delivers, and who have on us a very neceſſity of ſinning; and that he might know the ſinfulneſſe of ſinne. It was given, that it might work wrath; that is, the ſenſe and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Gods deſerved wrath. It was <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 15.</note> given, that the perfect holineſſe, and exact rigour of the juſtice of it might bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter down all confidence in humane good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, power of free-will, works of our righteouſneſſe; priviledges external, or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170485:28"/> any of our performances; and pound to pieces all confidence in the fleſh. It was given, to provoke ſinne. It was given, to <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 8</note> convince of our utter diſabilities.

It was given, that through the Law, we might for ever <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 19.</note> be dead to the Law; therefore the Law is a killing letter, (not a dead letter, no <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6, 7.</note> part of the Word of God is a dead letter; for then it could not be of ſuch power as to be a killing letter) and the Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Our evils are greater than can be removed by creatures; yet removed they muſt be, if any of us be ſaved; and our good, that we may be happy, is greater than can be by them communicated. The evil is, the infinite wrath of God, the guilt and damning nature of ſinne ſtanding in force, and confirmed by the ſtrength of an eternal perfect Law, the Empire of ſin and death, the power of the Divel that ſtrong armed man of whom we read, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 21, 22.

Man in himſelf hath no cauſe of glorying; and as to God, no cauſe of complaining. To the Elect man is there undeſerved grace; and to the Reprobate is there deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Elect and Redeemed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, till their effectual calling, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves miſerable, carnal, alienated from <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> the life of God, dead in ſinne and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, the children of wrath, even as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170485:34"/> grace, not one of them was ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to raiſe up himſelf to meet God in the wayes of his grace. God never gave Chriſt to any becauſe he was better than others, nor ſent the Goſpel to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would give it better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This only may be ſaid of him which is true of any other man, that being a reaſonable creature, and not a ſtock, or a brute beaſt, he is a ſubject upon which the glory of God and his Image may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtamped; but for any goodneſſe, or leſſe guilt, God findes them all in their blood, and wallowing in their filth, none righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, no not one; all altogether unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and abominable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That condemnation, death and hell have their power from ſinne: and ſinnes ſtrength to condemn lyeth in the Law and in the righteouſneſſe thereof; for mark here, God to deliver from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, condemns ſinne: and ſinne being the ſwerving from the righteouſneſſe of the Law, for which the Law ſentenceth the Tranſgreſſor thereof with the curſe, ſin is then utterly gone, when the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law is every way fulfilled. God therefore purpoſing to deliver, fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the very heart of ſinne, and taketh
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170485:34"/> it quite away by providing that the Laws righteouſneſſe be fulfilled. Hence it is manifeſt that this is an undoubted and firſt truth, that the Laws righteouſneſſe is the ſtrength of ſinne. The ſting of death is ſinne, and the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 56. Full ſalvation can no other way be wrought, but by unſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging death, and by fulfilling the Law; which is the only way to pluck out deaths ſting: let this be done, and the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from ſinne and death is full and compleat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That mercy in God cannot make him like of ſinne, or blinde him that he ſhould not ſee it, and the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it; or cauſe him to diſlike the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and of the juſt ſentence thereof: becauſe God cannot forgo his holineſſe, juſtice and omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. God condemned ſinne, that the righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; he condemns ſinne, he provides that the Law be fulfilled, and ſo he ſaves the ſinner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the benefit of Gods ſaving love, and of the Redemption by Chriſt, and of the Goſpel, is never to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man actually, till it be in him; and if
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170485:35"/> never in him, never was it to him inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally. God and Chriſt never intended life and righteouſneſſe to thoſe in whom he never fulfills it. This is taught in the words [in us.]</p>

                  <p>And <hi>fifthly,</hi> As the ground of the whole work here declared, and as the foundation of the Apoſtles argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this is taken for granted, that God of his infinite goodneſſe was reſolved to ſave ſome ſinnets out of fallen mankind, and to give unto them eternal life. Of this the beloved diſciple ſpeaketh, in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>This is the record that God hath given to us eternal life;</hi> and the reaſon thereof is nothing in the creature, but it is that in them whom he ſhall ſave, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 6, 7. &amp; 2. 7.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170485:35"/> and hell can hinder from taking full effect and accompliſhment.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme is this; ſinne is ſinne: the Law is the Law; God is God; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be ſaved as miſerable, vile, filthy and guilty as any: and yet Gods mercy magnified, Chriſts grace exalted, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſaved, and while ſaved, not left car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; but all that is done for him, hath its holy and bleſſed work in him.</p>

God gave the Law, and ſin was provoked, and the ſinner dyed; the ſinner looked to it, ſtood convinced it was holy, juſt and good, but the more ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſſe and life by it, his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the more appearing, and he unable to keep it, the more he lay under the curſe of it: God then takes this courſe, he'le ſend his own Sonne, and he ſhall bring righteouſneſſe and life to this helpleſſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; hence a fourth ſpecial doctrine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelf, proving the ſecond general, which ſheweth that this ſalvation in Chriſt muſt needs be compleat and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. It is this:</p>
                  <q>The very impoſſibility of the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <note place="margin">4. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of the Law to ſave, and the loſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the ſinner, is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing that moved God to ſave him by Jeſus Chriſt. Proved ten wayes.</note> life and ſalvation of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the Law, and the ſinfulneſſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170485:64"/> of miſerable fallen man which brought that utter weakneſſe upon the Law, was that and that onely from without that moved God to juſtifie and ſave a ſinner by Chriſt; and therefore it is a ſalvation glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, gracious and all-ſufficient.</q>
                  <p>This truth is evident divers wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which is the help when the Law cannot help, muſt needs be high and powerful; for firſt, The Law is the only way of life which God as Creator doth give to a reaſonable creature; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Law is ſo able, that (being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Gods own Covenant) it cannot be weakned but onely by accident; not by its own failing, but by ours: it is weak, but through the fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Law for righteouſneſſe, and Chriſt for righteouſneſſe, do ſtand in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 16, 21.</note> oppoſition; yet the Law is not againſt the Goſpel: the Law drives to Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; the Law is fulfill'd, when Chriſt is <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 21, 22.</note> received, the Law comes in that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Chriſt might be eſteemed, which elſe a proud ſinner would wholly neglect <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4</note> or pervert, and never underſtand aright; this is the help given of God, which is the end of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170485:65"/> 3. That help that is able to ſet fleſh, ſinful weak fleſh right in Gods High Court of Juſtice, <hi>(recta in curiâ,</hi> as Lawyers ſpeak) and to put ſtrength into it, and ſo make up the breach, ſo that both the Law ſhall ſtand in its full force and ſtrength, and yet the ſinner be righteous and live, that is altogether a Soveraign ſalvation: but ſuch is the help which Gods grace in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt doth bring; it puts forth its power gloriouſly efficacious, for and upon and in ſinful weak fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When that which deſerves that God ſhould caſt off, reprobate and condemn to hell for ever, and ſo glorifie his juſtice, is made the ground of giving Chriſt; what now can be alledged to hinder, if the Omnipotent, All-wiſe and All-gracious God be able to ſave a poor periſhing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if Chriſt the Sonne of God be able to help? ſinfulneſſe of fleſh is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ground. It deſerves damnation, as we ſee in the righteous ſentences of the Law, in the caſting away of Angels fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, in men whom God reprobates; the ſame reprobableneſſe is in the very Elect men, in all of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Iſa. 43. 22, 25.

                  <p> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> pleaded for God with <hi>Iſrael</hi> long ago, bringing in the Lord ſpeaking in his own words on this wiſe: <hi>Thou haſt not called upon me O Jacob, thou haſt been weary of me, O Iſrael; thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſinnes, thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities; I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſinnes.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. When this, that all help failes, and through mans own fault, ſhall be the riſe and advantage that God will take to give <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 5.</note> his Sonne to be the Chriſt and Saviour; this anſwers all objections. Now thus it ſtands here, none to help, none to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; therefore (ſaith God) my arme <note place="margin">Iſa. 41. 27, 28.</note> ſaves.

An unchangeable purpoſe of love within God himſelf according to the good pleaſure of his will, was the onely proper cauſe cauſing ſalvation, and therefore it muſt needs be firme as a foundation of God; by grace are we ſaved, above and againſt deſert.

                  <p n="1">1. I am a ſinner, and ſinne condemns me by the righteous ſentence of the Law which I have broken. It is anſwered, The Sonne of God is ſent in the fleſh for ſin, to be the ſacrifice to take it away, the Lamb of God ſlain in ſacrifice for the ſin of the world. God condemns ſinne, which would condemn thee; God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it in the fleſh of his own Sonne; as the Syriack readeth the words, <hi>in his fleſh,</hi> and the connexion of the words in theſe two verſes doth inforce that ſenſe; for he that ſent his own Sonne in the fleſh to condemn ſinne in the fleſh, and ſo ſave the ſinner, muſt needs condemn ſinne <hi>in his fleſh,</hi> and not in our fleſh; for had we born in our bodies the condemnation due by the Law for our ſinnes, we had periſhed everlaſtingly, and had for ever layn under the curſe of the Almighty Law-giver, but ſinne is expiated by a ſacrifice of infinite value, ſinne is condemned in the fleſh of Gods own Sonne; therefore thou ſhalt

                  <p n="2">2. The Law requireth perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and righteouſneſſe of the creature, and continuance in the ſame.

It is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Sonne of God hath fulfill'd the righteouſneſſe of the Law in thy nature for thee; for God ſent him in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinful fleſh, he ſent him about ſinne, that he in the fleſh, the humane nature, might fulfill the righteouſneſſe of the Law; therefore he was ſent not for himſelf, who was not obliged to the Law, but for us to fulfill it for us; therefore his obedience is thy obedience, his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thy righteouſneſſe. The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the righteouſneſs performed by him, is performed for thee, not for himſelf, it is thine: it is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe <hi>of God,</hi> of Gods appointing ordained for thee: it is the righteouſneſſe <hi>of faith,</hi> thine by believing, not by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; thou haſt not a righteouſneſſe of works, for thou art a ſinner, but here is a righteouſneſſe provided for a ſinner; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and it is thine; it is an everlaſting righteouſneſſe; live ever by believing, and

We advance godlineſſe, while our Doctrine forms it in power, and deſtroyes a powerleſſe form of it: we maintaine good workes, while through the Goſpel the ſinner is called to come to God through Chriſt alone, and God takes him into his own gracious and powerful hands, and makes, molds, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions him in his own workmanſhip in

                  <p>1. Attend the way and means whereby
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170485:113"/> you may receive the Holy Ghoſt; Seek the ſenſe and comfort of the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and the lively working of the Spirit of Sanctification and Adoption; for this purpoſe theſe are choice directions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Come out from the world, and give thy ſelf up to the Word.</hi> The world cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit; thou art among and of the world by nature; Come out from among them, &amp; touch not the unclean thing; come out from the worlds luſts, the worlds vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and pomps, the worlds traditions, the worlds Idols and ſuperſtitions, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and Devotions, as ever thou wouldeſt have God to receive thee into fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt his Sonne through the communion or communication of his Spirit; ſay of all theſe, What have I to do any more with you? the Spirit is the holy Spirit; the world and the things of the world are the unclean thing. The word is the vehicle, the Chariot of the Spirit; he ſpake by the Prophets and Apoſtles, and he for ever works in and by their doctrine. By the Word engrafted, the Spirit dwells in the heart; Receive the Word, let it be in the truths contained in it, as a heavenly Cyons, which entertained with meekneſs, and with laying aſide all ſuperfluity of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170485:113"/> wickedneſſe, may be ſo naturallized into thee, that thou mayeſt be turned into the nature of it, and then thou ſhalt finde the Holy Ghoſt enter into thee, and take up his habitation in thee: Let the Word of Chriſt dwell richly in thee in all wiſdome, and the Spirit of Chriſt will fill thee with grace and glory. The Scripture is the ſtore-houſe of Wiſdome; Wiſdome ſpeaks there; juſtifie Wiſdome, and thou art a childe of Wiſdome whom the Holy Ghoſt hath regenerated; this is the incorruptible ſeed of which Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are born anew; who is the ſpiritual, but he that is made up of the Word of God? he who hath the Word of Chriſt to be the reaſon of his reaſon, the light of his minde, the life of his heart, and the rule of his life, he is the Chriſtian indeed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but when thou comeſt to the Word, thou wilt be ſure to meet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs; no looking into that glaſſe, but thou wilt ſee all amiſſe. Chriſt knoweth he ſhall finde thee a fool, and a ſcorner; ſimple, and loving ſimplicity; ignorant, and hating knowledge; now know he will reprove, but yet with ſerious exhortations and alluring invitations, calling and crying after thee; what then is to be done?

Ask then, Ask of thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, Ask for his Sonne Chriſt Jeſus ſake, not for thy own ſake; this gift may be had for asking.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Let thy utter deſtituteneſs and</hi> want of the ſpirit the more felt, <hi>the more make thee athirſt;</hi> and then <hi>let thy thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſoul call and cry for this living water;</hi>

                  <p> Seventhly, <hi>Cheriſh the motions of the Spirit</hi> in and by the word moving upon thy heart. Its motions, that we may know them, are theſe. 1. The reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things ſupernatural, and the ſetting home of holy truths; he cauſeth by the Word, the light to ariſe and ſhine upon thee, and lets it in by the underſtanding upon thy heart, and thus is ſtriving with thee to give it entertainment. Shut not thine eyes, draw the curtain of neglect and ſecurity: open the doors and let the truth come cloſe to thy heart, and ſink down deep into thy ſoul. 2.

So the Spirit, it burneth out our luſts, it purifieth the ſoul, it giveth light and heat of knowledge and zeal, it maketh ſpiritual, and that which is of the Spirit is Spirit. The Spirit is like the holy fire which came down from heaven upon the

This is to be held firm againſt the vile and pernicious opinions of all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heretiques, and our newly up-ſtart erroneous ſpirits: and againſt the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſayings of Philoſophers, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tenets and expreſſions of ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as if the mind and ſoul were pure, and receiveth its defilement from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

It was in us in our very conception, it is bred up with us; It diſcovers it ſelf as we diſcover the uſe of our reaſon, and it will be in us while we are in this frame and building. Thirdly, becauſe we are as tender of it, as we are of our very fleſh. Fourthly, becauſe there is a body of it, a whole conſiſting of many members joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, and miniſtring nouriſhment to every part for the encreaſe of the whole. A whole compoſed heap, not only ſpreading it ſelf through the whole man, and diſcovering it ſelf in every member of the body; but having alſo all the ſeveral wickedneſſes which ever were committed in it, in the ſeed and ſpawn of them: It is not ſome one tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but many; as the body is not one member, but many; and theſe many are knit together in an helliſh order.

                     <hi>Walking after the Spirit,</hi> ſheweth that all grace is brought into us from without, from above, from the holy Ghoſt. It is not from a ſeed in us which is born with us, and lyeth as the ſeed of Corn doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while buried in the earth. It is not from any power or ſpirit that is in the Creature, or in this viſible Globe, or in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Angelical. It is from the Spirit of the Father and of the Sonne. Again, this ſheweth that all grace is yet truely in us, from the holy Ghoſt dwelling in us through the Word engraffed, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truth of the Goſpel; from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt thus dwelling in us, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſanctifying, acting, and leading of us.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In thoſe that are in Chriſt, in them there is the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> The Spirit
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170485:125"/> in renewing, unites to Chriſt: their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt is ſpiritual, not phyſical, not moral alone, not perſonal at all. The Spirit of Chriſt is in them, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to Chriſt, and Chriſt and they are <hi>one Spirit,</hi> as Man and Wife are one fleſh; this truth ariſeth from this deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption as it is referred to the words before in <hi>ver.</hi> 1. of this Chapter. <hi>To them that are in Chriſt there is no condemnation.</hi> Now this is to be underſtood of the holy Ghoſt, as he is the Anointing wherewith Chriſt is anointed, even Jeſus Chriſt, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as he is the Sonne of God ſimply and abſolutely, but as he is <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> God-man: and wherewith from Chriſt that Holy One, they are anointed: the work is the work of the third Perſon, but not a work that makes a perſonal union of them to the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Where the Spirit of Christ is in any, there is alſo fleſh,</hi> whiles they are in this life; where there is grace, there is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: though it holds not on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, where ever there is corruption, there is grace alſo. Nay, it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, untill regeneration there is nothing but corruption in any or all the men in the world, no, not in the elect of God:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170485:126"/> but where the Spirit is, there is fleſh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not walked after. This is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the deſcription as made up of a negative firſt, and then of an affirmative, which ſheweth a nature or diſpoſition in the deſcribed here, which is declining and renouncing one principle, and cleaving to and following ſweetly another princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Therefore with the regenerate it is thus, their works are mixed, their actings of their graces are mixt and maimed: All their beſt duties ſmell ſtrong of the fleſh; therefore the Regenerate ought to be watchful, and jealous over themſelves, humble to God-ward, meek towards man, and making uſe of Chriſt and faith in him in all, doing all in his name or mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and looking for acceptation of all in him alone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That <hi>fleſh, even in the regenerate and spiritual is ſo ſinful, that if it were follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would deſtroy them;</hi> therefore it is ſinne in it ſelf, and in the luſts of it, even in the regenerate; for if it were not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, why ſhould it be renounced? why ſhould it not at ſome times, and in ſome caſes be allowed?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Theſe two, the fleſh and the Spirit,</hi>

                     <hi>are contrary one to another.</hi> When the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170485:126"/> comes in and rules, and the fleſh or corruption of nature cannot rule more, yet it will never yield, it will ne're be good: it is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor can be; the beſt that can be made of it, is to mortifie it, crucifie it, fight it out againſt it; therefore from theſe two contrary principles in one and the ſame man it is that in the godly there is a continual fight or deadly war; and curſed be that that would make up a peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two; therefore hence it is that he that is born again, is born a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, lives by his ſpiritual ſword and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and dies in the Field, and ſo never dies but is a Conquerour in his death.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Where the Spirit is, he rules and reignes;</hi> he will not be underling, he leads where he is; all that is born of God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh the whole world. And the Spirits rule is ſet up by pulling the fleſh out of the Throne, and ſubduing its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; therefore the leaſt meaſure of true grace, the leaſt ſpeak of this holy fire, be it but as that <hi>in ſmoaking flax,</hi> is Soveraign, <hi>it is judgment which will come unto victory.</hi>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170485:130"/> in the Throne, and deſcry the Regency of the fleſh in the choiceſt works and means of Religion. And here we lay down this for a certain truth, that</p>
                  <q>There is not any outward duty, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or priviledge of Gods people, which the fleſh will not take to, and ſuck to her ſelf advantage out of it; ſhe is ſuch an hypocrite, and in her wickedneſſe hath wit at will.</q>
                  <p>Therefore ſee her Regency,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In prayer;</hi> they that live and walk <note place="margin">1. In pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Prov. 28. 9 Iſa. 1. 15.</note> in ſinne and diſobedience to the Word of God, may make many prayers; but an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination to the Lord are all their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will not heare when ye multiply prayers:</hi> for the fleſh hath the rule in them while they pray, and it is thus diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if an Heatheniſh ſpirit act them, <note place="margin">Seven wayes. Mat. 6. 5.</note> which thinketh God is well-pleaſed with the work done, or the cries of a natural heart, with a few good and holy words, with much ſpeaking, or with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and tale of our prayers, a touch and outſide of the duty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if a Phariſaical ſpirit act <note place="margin">Mat. 6 5.</note> them, which thinks to merit at the hands of God, and prayes to be ſeen of men, and to be accounted for devout.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:170485:131"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, if things ſpiritual be asked <hi>as ſavoured onely under carnal notions, and for carnal and worldly ends chiefly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the things of this life be <hi>asked onely:</hi> as there are multitudes who never offered any deſires to God that were the deſires of their hearts, but what were for health when they were ſick, or for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in their earthly Affairs, or for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance when they were in diſtreſſe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or for a plentiful Harveſt and good Crop, with ſuch like; or if the things of this life be asked <hi>chiefly;</hi> if God ſhould give us <hi>Solomons</hi> priviledge, and then we have not <hi>Solomons</hi> heart, nor <hi>Davids one thing,</hi> nor <hi>Agurs diſcerning feare of ſinne and temptations,</hi> with preferring of contentation with food and rayment; if the requeſts we offer up in the words of prayer be never ſo ſpiritual, and in the work the affections ſtir, and are jogging, and make a great noiſe, but it is all but for the time of prayer, when the conſtant bent of the heart is for covetouſneſſe, and the heart is ſet upon riches or the things of this life; or if the things of life be asked <hi>as temporals,</hi> and not that they may be ſpiritualized and ſanctified to us in their uſe; they cry as the young Ravens
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170485:131"/> cry, and pray as rhe Lyon hungry roars and ſeeks his meat of God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if temporal afflictions and judgments make us pray and cry, but not ſinne nor ſpiritual judgments; ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have not the heart to God in them, they are the <hi>howlings of wolves,</hi> and God <note place="margin">Hoſ. 7. 14</note> ſo reckons of them. Travellers, captives, ſick folks, ſea-men, and all under extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities will cry unto God in their troubles, and the Lord hears ſo as to deliver them out of theſe diſtreſſes; but if when they are delivered, ſinne be ſtill their Idol, and ſpiritual plagues are not felt, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor prayed againſt, but rather dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under, their prayers are but the cries of ſwine when they are pinched, and the cryes of nature to the Lord of nature.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if ſinne and the wrath of God, becauſe of guilt and conſciences gripes and ſentence; or if the Laws threatnings and denunciations of judgments out of the word, and the work of <hi>the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> which is upon us; if theſe do cauſe us to pray, cry out and repent, but yet there be no workings of the Spirit of grace and of Adoption, nor ſinnes filthineſſe and offence do put us to grief, and be a burden and heavy load, further then it is
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170485:132"/> abominable to the light of nature, and is cryed ſhame on in the world; this kinde of ſorrow for ſinne is no more than what may be found in a <hi>Cain,</hi> or in a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, if we pray, and becauſe we pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we now think our ſelves free to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne; we have been at prayer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may be at our lewdneſſe; we have been at Church in the fore-noon of the Lords day, therefore we may dance about the May-pole, and keep Revels in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noon; this is like the Harlot, who ſaith to the young Wanton, <hi>I have peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings with me, this day have I paid</hi>

                     <hi>my vows, therefore came I forth to meet thee.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. In reference to the Law of God; for though the fleſh is not, nor will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <note place="margin">2.

                  <p>Secondly, when we take the Law to be no more than as a Law commanding the <note place="margin">Ro. 7. 7, 9.

                  <p>Thirdly, when and whileſt that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to hear the holineſſe of the Law opened and urged; and we love not the righteouſneſſe and purity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; yet we will have the ſaying of the Commandments and the publick reading of them as part of Divine ſervice, and hold this better than all preaching, and without this we care not for Miniſter or preaching.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when all the fruit of the

                  <p>Thirdly, when we ſuffer but in faction, and do drive on worldly intereſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 1, 3.</note> and not out of love to Chriſt, his Goſpel, and to righteouſneſſe: or we ſuffer out of opinion of merit, not in ſelf-denial: or out of vain-glory, not with lowlineſſe and love of the brethren: or out of a Roman reſolution, as it is called, not out of a ſound mind: or out of tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe of what we have once profeſſed and maintained, not in obedience to the truth, ready to receive light from the Word, in caſe that any could evidence by the Scripture our miſtakes: or when we ſuffer upon deſign to get the more, as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, when we ſort and ſuit out holy truths and practices, and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, All theſe continued, but <note place="margin">Zach. 7. 5, 6, 7.</note> Refo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, God ſought with droves and heards for ſacrifice, with outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. 6. Mic. 6. 6, 7.

                  <p>Fourthly, When all our humiliations
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170485:141"/> are <hi>Ahabs</hi> humiliations; ſuch outward penitentials proceeding even from the belief of an <hi>Elijah's</hi> threatning, that they draw the eye of God and man, and receive ſome anſwers from God in temporal mercies: and yet <hi>Ahab</hi> is <hi>Ahab</hi> ſtill, <note place="margin">1 King. 21. 27, 29.</note> when that fit is over, and ſome breathing time given.</p>
                  <p>Again, in the work of Reformation, The unregenerate may cry, call Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, <note place="margin">About Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation five ways.

                  <p>More particularly, in Reformation the fleſhes Regency is diſcovered,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in a partial Reformation. This ſinne hath been too too palpable with us ſince our firſt juſt with-drawing from the bed of that Romiſh <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and caſting off the yoke of Romiſh Antichriſtian ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170485:141"/> In the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, the Popes ſupremacy was caſt off, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Popery retained: Witneſſe, the ſix Articles, for refuſal of which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles many faithful Chriſtians burnt at the ſtake. In King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth's reign, a gracious young Prince, when the worſhip of God was ſo far reſtored as to be Celebrated in the Mother tongue, and groſſe ſuperſtitions abandoned, the ſix Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles taken away, truth of doctrine held forth, nevertheleſſe, in ſome the fleſh ſo cunningly wrought that Leiturgy and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy were retained, and by a Law many holy dayes (as men call them) ranged in the ſame rank with the Lords day. In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes of bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the mind of the fleſh was ſo potent in many, that there was kept up a reading Miniſtery, Non-reſidency, and Pluralities, Ceremonies with ſubſcription, leiturgy with an encreaſe of length, Prelacy, the Royal Chappels and Cathedrals with chantings, Altars, Copes, Bowings at Altars, and at the name of Jeſus kept up, Croſſe in Baptiſme urged unto Suſpencion, and ejection of many choice Miniſters, Canons, Canonical obedience, and the abuſe of excommunication, with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170485:142"/> Courts, as they were carnally na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. In King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, beſides all the former continued with many acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the book of ſports was given out. In King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign, many corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Doctrine vented, the book of ſports urged upon Miniſters to publiſh it, the new-Canons with an oath made by the Convocation houſe, Altars and Organes brought into Pariſh Churches, with other of the like leaven: So that Reformation was highly needful. In the time of the Parliament in 1642. and forwards Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was ſolemnely Covenanted. An Aſſembly for that end called, the things of Jeſus Chriſt Covenanted, were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And now though no Popery, Prelacy, nor Leiturgy, bleſſed be the holy Name of our God: yet there is no confeſſion of faith for unity in Doctrine, no Directory for uniformity in worſhip, no Church-Diſcipline or Government, no Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, no Communion of Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of Churches, of Miniſters ſettled. Thus in the edificative part we may ſay, where ſhall our Reformation be found?
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170485:142"/> our Covenant Reformation where is it? The Lord hath been upon the work of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying and refining his Church for the ſpace now of above one hundred years, even ever ſince the year 1517. and he will effect it; ſhall he begin, and ſhall he not make an end? how is it that we are ſlack and follow not the Lord more fully, and obſerve not more his goings forth with <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s, ſaying, <hi>Save now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, ſend now prosperity.</hi> It was the <note place="margin">Ex. 10. 24, 26.</note> antient voice of the godly in this Land, <hi>a hoof muſt not be left behinde;</hi> let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume it, let us reſt aſſured that inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men muſt not come in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in abhorring one ſinne (as to the out-ſide) and ſetting-up another; as when it may be ſaid of us, <hi>thou that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreſt Idols, dost thou commit ſacriledge?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ro. 2. 22.</note> thou pulleſt down all the reliques of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and ſuffereſt not a Croſſe in a ſtreet, nor on a Steeple, nor an image painted in a Church-window, nor a conſecrated Font for Baptiſme, and thou doeſt well; and wilt thou continue in the ſinne of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; ſhall the maintenance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery <hi>that labours</hi> in the Word and Doctrine remain <hi>impropriated,</hi> in that very day when thy Supreme Governour who undertaketh
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170485:143"/> great things righteouſly for the good of the Church in all the world, cuts off all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary expences for his Court, needeth great ſupplies, doth yet freely give home the firſt fruits and renths (which none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before did do) to provide that there may be no ſcandalous livings in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whiles he endeavours the ejection of ſcandalous Miniſters? is that no ſcariledge now adayes, which was ſacriledge, and ſo preached and proved to be in all parts of the Land by the faithful Miniſters in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the execution of judgment, and in purſuing Reformation to be like <hi>Jehu;</hi> zealous for the Lord of Hoſts in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling <note place="margin">2 Kings 10. 28. 29, 30, 31.</note> the Word of the Lord againſt the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry of the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he could not live by faith above his carnal reaſon, that the ten Tribes ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the houſe of <hi>David</hi> in the line of <hi>Solomon,</hi> if they ſhould all come up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How hath it turned a man, a brave Prince <note place="margin">2 Kings 8. 12, 13.</note> into a dog! <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170485:143"/> own heart, who did live by faith, in the matter of getting and keeping a Crown and a Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in pretending zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and againſt Gods diſhonour, <note place="margin">Rev. 19. 18</note> and when God makes a Feaſt in the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his enemies to fall from the work begun, and to be like Vultures and Kites, and Birds of prey, feeding on the fleſh of Kings, Captains, and mighty men, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fifthly, in ſeeking to joyne with the ſincere in building the Lords Temple, that we may corrupt the ſtructure, or hinder the work, like the Adverſaries of the Jews <note place="margin">Ezr. 4. 1, 2, 3.</note> in the dayes of <hi>Ezrah.</hi>

                     <hi>Saint-ſouldiers.</hi> And Chriſtians may go farther, and yet be under the Regency of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they may enquire of God by his Prophets, by the Scriptures in their great expeditions; but herein they are like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> who ſaid there is one <hi>Micaiah,</hi> but I <note place="margin">1 Kings 22. 6, 8.</note> hate him; or they are like <hi>Johanan</hi> and his company, who will needs be ſatisfied what the Lords minde is, and promiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and binde it to the utmoſt; but when they underſtand that it is againſt their minde, they will abſolutely refuſe, and hold their own will and way; and <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet <hi>must be charged with speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſely in the Name of the Lord.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 42. 1, 2, 5, 6, 10. &amp; 43. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 1 Kings 22. 4.</note>

                  <p>Secondly, they may uſe the friendſhip, and ſeek and hold correſpondence with the truly godly, but it is like <hi>Ahabs</hi> compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> upon earthly grounds, and for worldly ends.</p>

                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>In ſincerity,</hi> ſuch holy plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12</note> perſpicuity and tranſparent clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which God worketh and witneſſeth withall, no way hypocritical and varniſhed over, but in ſimplicity purging from and ſtirring up himſelf againſt the hypocrite, and the hypocriſie of their own hearts. And all this <hi>by the grace of God,</hi> the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170485:156"/> free-grace of God which deſtroyes the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſinne in them, which thing the Law could not do; and by the which they are what they are in things pertaining to ſalvation; and by the gift of inherent grace which is now the leading principle guiding their converſation towards all men, and in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>In repentance, faith and love;</hi> that is, they make it their every dayes work to be renewing their repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, their faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and their love to the Word, to the Saints, and to all men.</p>
                  <p>All this the ſpiritual do do, not without the feelings and motions, but with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> ſtirring, egging and workings of the fleſh, inſomuch that they cannot do what they would, yet they truly would what they ſhould, and cannot do as they would. In all the eight fore-named, the fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary, is in them luſting againſt the Spirit, but is not yielded unto, nay, it is reſiſted with mighty luſtings, and ſtill theſe walkings are choſen; their hearts and lives ſpeak thus, Not the fleſh, but the ſpirit; not the world, but the Word; not luſt, but grace; not Satan, but Chriſt; not in darkneſſe as a night bird, as one of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170485:156"/> night and of darkneſſe, but in light, as a childe of light, and of the day; not in ſleep of ſecurity, but in awakings of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of a good conſcience; not in vanity, but in the power of Goſpel truths; not in hypocriſie with fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but in godly ſincerity by the grace of God; not in with-drawings and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of God, but with drawings near of faith in power to the ſaving of the ſoul; not in thoſe, but in theſe would I unfeignedly have my walks; not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit will I walk, is the language of the ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p>Again, the order of placing is very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant in this deſcription; he that is now in the Spirit, was firſt in the fleſh; he who now walks after the Spirit, had his former Converſation corrupt and after the fleſh; therefore the ſpiritual mans walk is thus: he is ever putting off, and <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22, 24, 25, &amp;c.</note> getting further from his former corrupt Converſation, and is putting on a renewed Converſation day after day.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, ſhall I hence preſent you <note place="margin">The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a ſpiritual man.</note> with the draught of <hi>a spiritual</hi> man? <q>
                        <hi>The ſpiritual man</hi> is one, who, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regenerated and ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, who in that work gives

The Law of God is in his heart, guiding his ſteps that none of them do ſlide; he is a walking bible; he is the Epiſtle of Chriſt of the beſt Edition, ſo fair written that it is to be ſeen and read of all men. Grace in his heart is ſtamped upon his daily courſe; from a good treaſure within he bringeth forth good things; he is married to Chriſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from the dead, that he might bring forth fruit unto God; to him to live is Chriſt, being of the truth, and of the day; he walks Goſpelly-genteel <note n="*" place="margin">

He cannot abide hypocriſie, and loves nothing below that converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the grace of God in Chriſt teacheth. He is paſſing on from faith to faith, from glorious grace to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grace, from ſtrength to ſtrength, as one called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to glory and vertue; but ſpeeding his way through daily mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and crucifixions of a home ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my within his own bowels, he walks in the Spirit, and ſo fulfills not the luſts of the fleſh; he walks not after the fleſh, that he might walk cloſely after the Spirit; he that walks after the fleſh, knows not the fleſh ſo well as he; he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids and paſſes by, he comes not near, but goes away from the fleſh's walks: for he hates the garment ſpotted with the fleſh. He would not defile his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for fine linnen, clean and white is his cloathing, even the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes of the Saints, all wrought without hands, as himſelf is the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God in Chriſt Jeſus by the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170485:158"/> Spirit in a new Creation: yet ſince that the fleſh will be with him, the heighth of his ſpiritual temper is this; he will take his garments and his fine array, and waſh them white in the blood of the Lamb.</q>

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170485:159"/> The walk, the converſation ſhews the man; try then who hath the command of our lives; obſerve that; for <hi>if we live after the fleſh, we ſhall dye for ever;</hi> but <hi>if through the Spirit we mortifie the deeds of the body,</hi> our members that are on earth, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13</note> as uncleanneſſe, covetouſneſſe and the like, <hi>we ſhall live</hi> for ever, and never be damned. There are but two principles that rule the man; one of theſe have the command of all men; where the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, there the other cannot; that commands that hath power over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. It's luſtings and motions are reigning indeed, that frame the walk of a man. It is then no difficult thing to know what we are by our walks; look upon your walk, and ſee your eſtate. The works of the fleſh are <hi>manifeſt;</hi> read, and ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21. And the fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are many, and go in a chain unſevered; <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> they are ſweet; and ripe, not rotten, not hedge-fruit they are ſuch againſt which there is no Law, although they are Goſpel-fruit, &amp; never grew but in that ſoil. Did ever any men make a Law againſt them? and the Law of God is wholly for them. Be not deceived by profeſſion and perſwaſion that thou haſt ſpiritual life
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170485:159"/> within thee, if that inward ſpiritual life do not come forth in power to frame thy converſation after it, and no more after <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 25, 26.</note> the fleſh. <hi>If we</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>do live in the Spirit, let us walk in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> have you ſpiritual life in you? have a ſpiritual converſation alſo; have a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al converſation, and you <hi>ſhall not fulfill</hi> the luſts of the fleſh, though you have fleſh, and the fleſh luſting in you. The ſinnes of the godly are not as the ſinnes of the wicked; and the manifeſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is this, the godly have <hi>no way</hi> of wickedneſſe in them, no ſinne is their way <note place="margin">Pſ. 139. 24</note> and trade, no ſinne commands their walk; they may fall into a ſinne, as a wicked man may ſometimes fall upon a duty, but that is not their courſe, they up again, and walk on in Gods way which their ſouls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in and chooſe, humbled and aſhamed, and ſpeeding their way the more; their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in the Law of the Lord; now that allows no ſinne, neither do they; every word of God is pure, ſo is their way, and purity of way is that they love; there is no wickedneſſe in all the words of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; he that delights in the Word of God as his guide, ſhall of neceſſity be led in wayes wholly differing from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,

Mark here theſe three diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing points in the trial of our eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the ſpiritual takes the Spirit for the Commander and Orderer of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; as he would have the Holy Ghoſt live and rule in his heart and his ſoul live in the power of the Spirit given to him, and dwelling in him, ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to walk in the Spirit; the ſpiritual mans walk is a walk after the Spirit.</p>

                     <hi>the Spirit against the fleſh proves thy good eſtate.</hi> Not that it is good or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable that there is fleſh, and that it luſteth; but that there is Spirit luſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and that there is a combating with it which thou deſireſt to maintain; this is good and comfortable. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is known thus; it is not only between the conſcience and the will, but between

And ſince the ſcope of the whole diſcourſe from ver. 1. to ver. 17. of this chapter, is to ſupport and encourage theſe ſpiritual, holy wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in their way; the burden and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſin in them ſhould not break their ſpirits, or diſcourage them in the courſe of their holy living; the miſerable conflicting toyle of a gracious heart with the ſinne dwelling in him, is the thing treated of in the perſon of holy <hi>Paul,</hi> repreſenting all
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170485:171"/> the regenerate, in chap. 7. the latter part of it: and the 8. chapter to ver. 17. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is on purpoſe adjoyned to back on thoſe Combitants in their warre againſt the fleſh; their ſinne muſt not dishearten them in the combate; this is the force of that word, <hi>Now;</hi> it is a word of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; as if he ſaid, therefore ſince Chriſt is your deliverer, for and through whom ye may bleſſe God, and rejoyce with thankfulneſſe, in the very heat and worſt of the battel with your ſinnes; ſince fleſh, and you who are under the Law of your minds, and are regenerate, are two; <hi>Now, Now</hi> therefore ſtand to it and fight it out, there is no condemnation to ſuch as you. And let this word <hi>for,</hi> in theſe verſes of my Text be carried to the ver. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately going before it, and then they perſwade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe holy walkers to give up themſelves fully, chearfully, and without fear of miſcarrying, to the Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus which will certainly carry through, without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril from the Law of ſin and death which threatens them.

                  <p>The ſinnes of thoſe that walk after the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170485:171"/> Spirit, ſhall never be to their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither ſhall they hinder to them the benefit of all the ſalvation that cometh by Chriſt, nor ought in the leaſt kind to hinder their aſſurance, or their comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble walking in their obedience, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant combating againſt the fleſh, or their full dedition to the Law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus, as to that which will deliver from the Law of ſin and death.</p>

                  <p>Sinnes of infirmity are found in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate only, who have the life of grace begun. No weakneſſe where no life. Weakneſſe is properly in thoſe who have and retain a ſincere, univerſal, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant inclination to ſpiritual things as the beſt. No infirmity where the Spirit of Chriſt dwells not: Although the inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

No infirmity in thoſe that have not gracious principles, for in ſuch the deadly law of ſinne hath domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. No failings, where no right judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to place us upon high and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ends and aimes.

                  <p>Infirmities, are thoſe ſinnes which are the matter of dayly humiliation, and the objects of dayly mortification. It is not of infirmity to pleaſe our ſelves in our weakneſſe, to plead for it, or to allow of it.</p>
                  <p>There are infirmities which are not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to be rooted out, when yet the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſtrive daily againſt them: as forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, heavineſſe of Spirit, diſtractions in duty, ſudden paſſions, fears, ſecret fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiveneſſe of heart from under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, ſome kind of raſhneſſe and rudeneſſe of ſpirit in our approaches to God, covetings or hanckerings after the creature inordinately, with many of like ſort: and there are infirmities more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued, as are all the frailties which break out in geſtures, words, and actions; the Apoſtle gives us the ground of ſuch a

                  <p>Now having treated thus of ſins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, <note place="margin">What is meant in ſaying ſins of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall not condemn.</note> this doctrine ſheweth</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that theſe ſinnes of infirmity, ſhall not condemn thoſe that are guilty of them. Not as if their great ſinnes ſhall condemn them: no, for Jeſus Chriſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates not only for leſſer ſinnes, but for the greateſt ſinnes: and God forgiveth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, tranſgreſſion, and ſinne; ſinnes of all ſorts, and of all ſizes; but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that Chriſt is ſuch a propitiation that theſe are covered; ſuch an Advocate that he pleads to the Father, that theſe by <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1.</note> the tenour of the Covenant of grace be wholly paſſed by; he is ſuch an high Prieſt, as is touched with the feeling of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; for though he never knew what it was to ſinne, no, not of infirmity; he knew no ſin: yet he was tempted, and ſo <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> is touched with the feeling of the ſtate of one that cannot be free from ſome touch of defilement when he is tempted. God
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170485:175"/> is a Father who is ſo far from being angry <note place="margin">Pſa. 103. 13 Mal. 3. 17.</note> with his children for theſe meer infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he pities them, ſpares them, and makes them up as his Jewels; but as for their g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oſſe ſinnes, they are they for which their Father is angry, with-holds his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, his Spirit, and their joy: and no conſolation to them in ſinnes they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge, untill they be humbled deeply. Again, underſtand this aright: Theſe ſins condemn not; not as if leſſer ſinnes were not diſpleaſing unto God their Father, to Chriſt their Lord, and to the Spirit their Leader: nor as if they might not be ſo committed, that they may become great ſinnes, through careleſſeneſſe and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo as they may be circumſtanced. Nay. A failing may be ſo allowed, ſo cuſtomary, ſo malapertly, and frowardly excuſed and pleaded for, that it may have too much of preſumption in it: and ſo have much wickedneſſe in it, and have much of the nature of a great tranſgreſſion; and therefore may have in it much provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that which calls for great humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, before any comfort can flow into the ſoul of ſuch a one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, theſe ſinnes of infirmity ought not to hinder aſſurance: that is, the

They have had experience of the power of the Goſpel, that Law of the Spirit: It hath

                  <p n="1">1. Conſider what is wrought for and in a poor ſinful creature before he can attain to this, to walk after the Spirit. Firſt, the Word of Gods grace, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of ſalvation is preached by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles with the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven, and by Paſtours and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſent of Chriſt, who in his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to glory in heaven hath received and given theſe gifts for men; this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is brought even unto thee in its truth and purity in theſe latter difficult times, although falſe teachers have and do abound. It is the firſt ſtep of Gods approach in his way of ſaving mercy coming down from heaven to bring thee to glory. Then ſecondly, God by his
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:170485:192"/> Spirit through the Goſpel preached which is his teſtimony, illightens thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals the things of ſalvation, the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of hidden wiſdome unto thy ſoul. Thirdly, he enables thee to chooſe Chriſt Jeſus and his Goſpel above all other Religions whatſoever, abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them; and above thine own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thoughts, inventions, luſts and ways: and above thine own reaſon, and thine own righteouſneſſe, and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is of the Law. Fourthly, the Spirit in and by the Goſpel coming into thee, ſets thee free from the reign and dominion of the fleſh, of its mindings, of its wiſdome, and of its wills, deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Fifthly, the Spirit quickens the and gives thee life; a new life, life from above, the life of grace which will be glory, a life which is eternal in the beginning of it; and being quickned and raiſed together with Chriſt, ſets thee on thy feet, takes thee by the hand, and teaches thee to go. Sixthly, the Spirit gives thee an heart to order thy converſation aright, acording
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170485:193"/> to the holy Commandments as becometh the Goſpel, from the power of faith and hope which ſet thee on high, even to ſit together with Chriſt in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places from whence thou lookeſt for him, inſomuch that thy converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in heaven. Seventhly, he gives thee power to walk after him, going before thee in the Goſpel, engrafting the Word on thy heart, and thereby coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling, teaching, exciting and inclining, or bowing thy will as powerfully as ſweetly, drawing and making thee to runne in Gods ways. Eighthly, and with this power he gives a quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, and ſenſe of the fleſh, and of its motions, counſels and ways, with reſolutions mighty and prevailing to the framing of the courſe of the life, not to walk after the fleſh, but to hold on thy walk after the Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it, though the fleſh be ſtill contrarily luſting and working, plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and warring.</p>
                  <p>Thus the regenerate and ſpiritual, though hampered and toyled with his corrupt nature, walks not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:170485:193"/>
                  <p> Doth ſo much go to make thee a holy liver, and is not the work very great? oh have not any low thoughts of this high mercy, for which thou canſt never ſufficiently bleſſe the Lord, nor canſt retain the thankful ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of further nor longer than thou keepeſt up the thoughts of thine own, and all mens alienations by nature from the life of God.</p>
                  <p>Believe it brethren, it is not a mean, deſpicable work to frame the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or walk according to the Word of Chriſt. It is not little in it ſelf, although it ſeemeth to thee a ſmall and little thing, through vehement deſires, and longings in thee after greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in the way called holy, in which thy ſoul finds ſuch pleaſures that thou art impatient of contrary workings, and of interruptions; let me tell thee who thus walkeſt, the work is ſo great, that it carries the heart to the leadings of the Spirit, and the heart is powerfully wrought upon and changed, which none can bow and turn but God that made it, or elſe it could not ſo powerfully order the converſation. This is more
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170485:194"/> then to delight in Gods Word and ways, and yet that is a mighty work of grace; obſerve for this, <hi>Davids</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy Commandments, for therein do I delight.</hi>

                     <hi>To will</hi> is of Gods gracious work; <hi>To delight</hi> in Gods Commandments is the top, and that which ſhews and proves the truth of the work of grace upon the ſoul enabling to will; but <hi>to do, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,</hi> is more by farre. God and Chriſt by the Holy Spirit have the laſt <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> hand put to the work of ſalvation as farre as agreeth to his Saints in this life, when the Spirit rules thy walk.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Behold here the worth of ſuch a Chriſtian. He is Gods workmanſhip in Chriſt Jeſus, created again unto good works which God hath fore-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that he ſhould walk in. In this walk, ſee the man come out of Gods hands in the regeneration. This is a choice creature, made up to and by the will of the Spirit, and his walk ſpeaks it. Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile. God hath ſet out two admirable ſights once in this ſinful wicked world, unto which
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:170485:194"/> all eyes ſhould be turned; the Lambe of God that taketh away the ſinne of the world; and the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from this evil world, redeemed from all iniquity, purified to be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people to himſelf, zealous of good works. This a choice creature, as for priviledges and dignity, ſo for heavenly qualifications.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take here the maine reaſon, why many under the Goſpel attain not to a holy life, which is this, they take up with that light and with thoſe gifts, which will not ſubdue, mortifie and crucifie the fleſh; they profeſſe the Goſpel, but the Goſpel is not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple they live by; and no other, no lower will deſtroy the reign of ſinne; the holy Law will not, therefore no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion, no Inſtitutions of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, no light of the Law within man can ſubdue the fleſh; the Goſpel alone, if received into the heart, will do it, becauſe it gives the Spirit; now they by the Goſpel never received the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Sanctification, and of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170485:195"/> Untill this be had, none can attain to an holy life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Take hence alſo the main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why the regenerate attain unto ſo little comfort; for firſt, they place not as they ſhould the ground-work of their comfort, in this, <hi>That they are in Chriſt, which this their walk doth evidence;</hi> but they ſeek it in their walking, which, accompanied with ſinnes and contrary luſtings, will beare no higher than to the power of an evidence, and to a begunne work which is true, but yet but in a part, and yet ſuch as is tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto, and will attain perfection, but not in this life; but it is not a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to ſtand in, without ſpot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of God, it is not a Righteouſneſſe to juſtifie a ſinner in Gods ſight, it is not a Righteouſneſſe that God ever appointed for ſuch a work or purpoſe. And ſecondly, they think to ſqueeze out the comfort of their being in Chriſt, and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to thoſe that are in Chriſt by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, objecting, and ſeeking reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their objections, and by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170485:195"/> of themſelves by all the light they can get, which things are good in themſelves, and duties as we may have opportunities, but not the main thing; for they ſhould ſeek their comfort and ſettlement chiefly by wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on holily; great eſtabliſhment is in well-doing. Comfort ſhould not be expected preſently, it muſt have a time to ſpring and ripen upon a Tree of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which the Lord hath planted, and which brings forth the fruits of righteouſneſſe, and than the bleſſing of comfort. By diligent adding of one <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5, 8, 10.</note> grace to another in our practice, we become fruitful in the knowledge of Chriſt, and ſo we make our calling <note place="margin">Iſa. 32. 17.</note> and election ſure. A barren life, be the knowledge never ſo great, and the profeſſion never ſo high, ſtrict and ſplendid, will be but unſetled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable. The fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is peace, and the effect of it is quietneſſe and aſſurance for ever.</p>

Thou haſt great encouragement in thy leader, and in thy way; the leader is the Spirit, the Spirit of Adoption, the Spirit in the New Teſtament diſpenſation, the higheſt that ever ſhall be till our Lord Chriſt appears in his glory and great power at the laſt day. Thy way, it is the way of all Saints and believers from the beginning of the world; this was the character of the godly in all ages, as <hi>Henoch, Noah,</hi> before the flood, <hi>Abraham, David, Hezekiah, Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the holy Apoſtles, and all other the Saints of God, <hi>to walk with God.</hi> It is the way of the upright not to look what ſtrength and meaſure of grace they have, and what they have done, or to think they are already perfect, but waiting on him who is their ſtrength to go on and reach forth to that which is before, eying the price of their high calling in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. It is the ſureſt way to comfort,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:170485:196"/> not to look chiefly to our affections, feelings and joyes, but to our walks; and this is moſt diſtinguiſhing; this brings moſt glory to God, and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to others. Others by the ſtory of our affections, joyes, experiences, may be made fancyfull, and put into a fools Paradiſe, and be raiſed to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our perſons, which ends u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually in imitating our evils, or in doating upon ſome phraſe of words, or noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and high ſtrains of opinion, or in ſelf-admiration, as having themſelves out-ſtripped us, and all others, and they are diſdained now as low and carnal in compariſon of themſelves, as much as before they were exalted and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by them as the onely ſpiritual. It is moſt comfortable and excellent when our lives confute our reaſonings, anſwer our objections, ſhew our faith, confirme our intereſt in Chriſt; as it is moſt comfortleſſe and abominable when our joyes, perſwaſions, confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hopes, and our faith alſo are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by our lives.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, be putting in ſtill into thy aright ordered Converſation <hi>that which is lacking;</hi> enlarge thy heart to all the Articles of faith, that their mold and ſtamp may be upon thy life; to all the Commandments that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of them may be reſpected and expreſſed; and to all Chriſts Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances that the fruit and ſpecial ends of them for which they were inſtituted for the benefit of Gods Elect may be attained, and be made more and more manifeſt, that they are attained.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Be not hearkning what thine own heart ſaith, but what the Lord ſaith by his Spirit in the Word, who

                  <p>Fourthly, Be not wicked over-much; when thou carrieſt a ſtrict hand over thy ſinful deceitful heart, lookeſt over thy wayes with as prying an eye as can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice it ſelf, or thy vigilant enemy the Divel himſelf, ſo farre as truth will bear; judgeſt thy ſelf ſeverely, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt as one condemned in the fleſh; ſee <note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 17</note> what Chriſt hath done for thee; what the Spirit hath wrought in thee; be not ſo fooliſh as to deny his grace in thee, which thy walk ſpeaks and teſtifies for thee to thy conſcience, and before God and men; why ſhouldeſt thou ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly torment thy ſelf, and dye before thy time? As it is evil to be righteous over-much by arrogating to thy ſelfe more than is right: ſo is it a dangerous evil to be wicked overmuch in denying or undervaluing what God hath graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought in thee.

And canſt thou not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide where the Holy Ghoſt is willing to reſide and dwell? whom makeſt thou thy ſelf! conſider who is thy next neighbour; keep in the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſolace thy ſelf in thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter who dwells in thee, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt never walk in fellowſhip with the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, why goeſt thou not the right way to work, even to give up thy ſelf unto the command of the Spirit, who treats with thee by the Word, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in thee whiles the Word of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in thee?</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, pay the fleſh home for its naughtineſſe and all its pranks, but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Spirit.</p>

                     <p>Now I commend you to God, and to the Word of his grace, the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which the Holy Ghoſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and which alone he accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the making ſinners wiſe to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by faith which is in Jeſus Chriſt; that you all may be under the teachings, guidance and leading of that one Spirit, may in his light behold the glory of theſe three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in heaven, which three are one Jehovah; and may in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip and ſervice, and in all your wayes acknowledge, draw near and have acceſſe unto God the Father, through Jeſus Chriſt his onely begotten Sonne our Lord, by the Spirit; ſo be it, even ſo be it.</p>
